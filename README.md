Password Strength Assessment Tool

Objective:

The goal of this project is to develop a tool that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords by analyzing key factors like length, complexity, uniqueness, and entropy. The tool provides real-time feedback to help users create strong and secure passwords, reducing the risk of security breaches.

Key Features:

1.Password Length Analysis:

• Longer passwords are more secure. The tool checks for passwords of at least 12 characters, with feedback based on password length.

2.Complexity Check:

• A good password should contain a mix of:

• Lowercase letters

• Uppercase letters

• Numbers

• Special characters (e.g., @, #, $).

• The tool encourages users to incorporate a variety of character types.

3.Uniqueness Check:

• The tool flags repetitive characters and common patterns (e.g., “1234”, “abc”, or “password”), which reduce password strength.

4.Entropy Calculation:

• Entropy measures how unpredictable the password is.

• The higher the entropy, the stronger the password.

• The tool calculates entropy and provides feedback accordingly.

5.Feedback Mechanism:

• Users receive real-time feedback on their password’s strength (e.g., Weak, Moderate, Strong).

• Suggestions are given for improving weak passwords (e.g., increase length, add special characters, avoid common patterns).

6.Technical Approach:

1.Password Analysis Algorithms:

• Length Check: Passwords shorter than 8 characters are flagged as weak, while those over 12 characters are considered strong.

• Check: The algorithm searches for the inclusion of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

• Pattern Detection: Common patterns and repeated sequences (e.g., “qwerty” or “aaa”) are identified and discouraged.

• Entropy Calculation: Based on character set size and password length, entropy is calculated to measure randomness.

2.Security Considerations:

• The tool avoids storing passwords in plain text or transmitting sensitive information.

• Additional checks can be incorporated to prevent users from using weak or compromised passwords (e.g., via integration with a database of common passwords).

Implementation Details:

Programming Language: Python (can be adapted to JavaScript or other languages for web-based tools).

Key Libraries:

• Re (for regular expressions to check password patterns and complexity)

• Math (for entropy calculation).

Further Enhancements:

1.Integration with front-end

Implement a web interface where users can type their passwords and receive real-time feedback. This can be done using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

2.Password Storage Check:

Compare entered passwords against known compromised passwords using services like HaveIBeenPwned or local common password databases.

3.User-specific Feedback:

Prevent users from incorporating easily guessable personal information (e.g., parts of their email, username, or phone number).

4.Graphical Indicator:

Add visual aids like strength bars that change color based on password strength (green for strong, red for weak).

Potential Use Cases:

End Users: Individuals can assess the strength of their passwords when creating new accounts or updating old ones.

Enterprises: Organizations can incorporate this tool into user registration and authentication systems to encourage employees and customers to create secure passwords.

Web Applications: This tool can be integrated into websites that require password creation, ensuring that users follow best practices for password security.
